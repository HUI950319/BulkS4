Description: Provides S4 classes and methods for comprehensive bulk RNA-seq data analysis,
    including differential expression analysis using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom,
    gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). 
    The package offers a unified framework for storing and analyzing bulk RNA-seq 
    data with associated metadata, supporting multiple analysis workflows and 
    comparison of different methods. Includes curated gene sets from MSigDB and 
    example datasets for demonstration and testing.
